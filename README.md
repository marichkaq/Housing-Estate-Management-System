# Housing-Estate-Management-System

Welcome to the Housing Estate Management System repository! This project involves creating a comprehensive application for managing housing estates, including apartments and parking spaces, and handling tenant information and rental processes.

Project Overview:

Key Features:
* Manage multiple housing estates with various apartments and parking spaces.
* Each apartment and parking space has unique identifiers and volume information.
* Tenants can rent apartments and parking spaces, with the first tenant responsible for rental fees.
* Implement rental upgrades and manage multiple rentals per tenant with a limit of five.
* Automatically generate unique identifiers for apartments and parking places.
* Calculate room volume based on user input (cubic meters or dimensions).
* Maintain and update tenant information, including rental start and end dates.
* Generate and store tenant letters upon rental expiration.
* Handle rental renewals and cancellations.
* Implement a time-passing mechanism using threads.
* Classify and manage vehicles with specific characteristics.
* Save and load housing estate data in a human-readable format.

Technologies Used:

* Java for application development.
* Multithreading with the Thread class for simulating time and handling animations.
* Serializable interface for persisting high scores and tenant information.
* Custom exceptions to handle specific scenarios (e.g., TooManyThingsException, ProblematicTenantException).

Key Functionalities:

* Create Housing Estate: Initialize housing estates with apartments and parking spaces.
* Tenant Management: Add, update, and manage tenant information.
* Rental Process: Handle rental of apartments and parking spaces, including upgrades.
* Time Simulation: Use threads to simulate the passage of time and rental expiration checks.
* Vehicle Management: Insert and manage vehicles with specific characteristics.
* Data Persistence: Save and load housing estate data, ensuring persistence of tenant information and rental records.


Project Insights:
This project was a significant learning experience, undertaken at the start of my programming journey. Through its implementation, I gained valuable knowledge in:

* Multithreading for simulating real-time processes.
* Object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance and polymorphism.
* Handling data persistence with the Serializable interface.
* Designing custom exceptions and error handling mechanisms.
Looking back, I see many areas for improvement and optimization, reflecting my growth and deeper understanding of software development. This project laid a solid foundation for my continued learning and development in programming.
